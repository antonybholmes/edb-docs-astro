## Introduction

The GSEA app allows you to reformat GSEA data from the Broad GSEA tool. It can create cleaner GSEA plots as SVG making them more suitable for publication.

## Loading Data

1. Find the directory containing the output from the GSEA tool.
2. Create a zip file of the directory and all its contents.
3. Use the <strong>Open</strong> button on this page to upload the zip file.

## Selected gene sets

Use the <strong>Gene Sets</strong> tab on the right to select which gene sets you want to display. The search bar allows you to filter the gene sets by name if there are many and you want to find a gene set quickly.

## Customizing plots

Use the <strong>Plot</strong> sidebar to adjust plot options including size, layout and colors.

## Exporting data

Use the <strong>Download</strong> button on the <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>File</strong> menu to export the plot as an SVG or PNG image.
